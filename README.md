Pick and place robotic arms are rapidly changing the dynamics found in the workplace. This project focuses on how our team approached the bi-annual competition Pick
and place challenge hosted by the Dept of MEAM, the University of Pennsylvania, as part of the course MEAM 5200: Introduction of Robotics. 

The scope of this project is to implement and assess different planning and control methods and come up with a complete module for pick and place of static and dynamic objects.
